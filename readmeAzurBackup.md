#  Setting Up and Using the Project for Automated Virtual Machine Backup with Azure Backup
Project Overview:

*This project demonstrates the process of automating the backup of virtual machines (VMs) on the Azure platform using Azure Backup service. You will create and configure a backup plan that regularly creates copies of data from your virtual machine and stores them in a secure vault on Azure.*

## **Technologies:**

    Azure Backup
    Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
    PowerShell or Azure CLI
    GitHub

*Steps to Create the Project:*:star::star::star::star::star:

    Creating Resources on Azure:
        Create a resource group on Azure for your project.
        Create a virtual machine (VM) that you intend to backup.

    Configuring Azure Backup:
        Create a Backup vault service on Azure.
        Create a backup plan, specifying your virtual machine as the backup source.

    Automation using ARM Templates:
        Create an ARM template for automatically provisioning resources on Azure (resource group, backup vault).
        Specify parameters for your ARM template, including the resource group name, virtual machine details, and backup plan settings in Azure Backup.

    Deploying the Project:
        Save your ARM template in a GitHub repository.
        Use PowerShell or Azure CLI to deploy your project using the ARM template.
        Verify the successful deployment and configuration of the backup.

This provides a basic outline of the steps to create and use the project for automated virtual machine backup on Azure using Azure Backup. For more detailed instructions, refer to the official Azure documentation as well as documentation on ARM templates and working with PowerShell or Azure CLI.
